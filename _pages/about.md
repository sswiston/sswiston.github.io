I am currently a sixth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Ecology & Evolutionary Biology program at Washington University in Saint Louis. I am in the lab of [Michael Landis](https://landislab.org/), where we develop mathematical models to study evolution.

My work focuses on phylogenetic methods for historical biogeography. I am especially interested in investigating the relationships between evolving lineages and their environments, developing models that incorporate paleogeographic and paleoenvironmental information alongside phylogenetic and species range data. I have done work on both lizards and plants, but herpetology will always have my heart.

Methods development also involves the creation of user-friendly software, tutorials, and workshops. To make the phylogenetic software required to run our models more approachable, I created a containerized set of programs using Docker. The [PhyloDocker](https://hub.docker.com/r/sswiston/phylo_docker) image allows users to bypass the lengthy installation process and version compatibility problems. I also participated in the creation of a series of [RevBayes tutorials](https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/fig_intro/) and teaching materials for the [Phylogenetic Biogeography Workshop](https://sites.wustl.edu/hawaiianplantbiogeography/phylogenetic-biogeography-workshop-wustl/), which I co-instructed at Washington University in Saint Louis (June 2024) and at Evolution (June 2025).

I am also committed to teaching and pedagogical research. I have obtained a Teaching Citation and completed the [Professional Development in Teaching](https://ctl.wustl.edu/professional-development-in-teaching/) program through the Washington University Center for Teaching and Learning ([CTL](https://ctl.wustl.edu/)), which involved several teaching and mentorship experiences, workshops, and the implementation of an [education research project](https://ctl.wustl.edu/teaching-the-teachers-investigating-the-impact-of-a-phylogenetic-biogeography-workshop-through-sotl/). My project centers on assessing the efficacy of the Phylogenetic Biogeography Workshop and the activities we incorporated. This year, I became a graduate student fellow at the CTL, working on developing and implementing programming for other students.

Using the course design strategies I have learned through my work with the CTL, I am currently developing a graduate-level course called Mathematical Modeling in Ecology and Evolution, which I will teach in Spring 2026 as an instructor of record.

<!-- My career goals are to teach biology at a primarily undergraduate institution, to mentor undergraduate researchers, and to continue engaging in pedagogical research. -->

I am planning to defend my dissertation in Summer 2026, and am currently applying to positions. A full CV can be found here: [CV](http://sswiston.github.io/files/Swiston_CV.pdf)
