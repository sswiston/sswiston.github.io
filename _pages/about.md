I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Ecology & Evolutionary Biology program at Washington University in Saint Louis. I am in the lab of [Michael Landis](https://landislab.org/), where we develop mathematical models to study evolution.

My work focuses on phylgenetic methods for historical biogeography. I am especially interested in investigating the relationship between evolving lineages and their environments, developing models that incorporate paleogeographic and paleoenvironmental information alongside phylogenetic and species range data.

Methods development also involves the creation of user-friendly software, tutorials, and workshops. To make the phylogenetic software required to run our models more approachable, I created a containerized set of programs using Docker. The [PhyloDocker](https://hub.docker.com/r/sswiston/phylo_docker) image allows users to bypass the lengthy installation process and version compatibility problems. I also participated in the creation of a series of [RevBayes tutorials](https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/fig_intro/) and teaching materials for a [Phylogenetic Biogeography Workshop](https://sites.wustl.edu/hawaiianplantbiogeography/phylogenetic-biogeography-workshop-wustl/), I co-instructed at Washington University in Saint Louis in June 2024.

I am also committed to teaching and pedagogical research. I have obtained a Teaching Citation and completed the [Professional Development in Teaching](https://ctl.wustl.edu/professional-development-in-teaching/) program through the Washington University Center for Teaching and Learning ([CTL](https://ctl.wustl.edu/)), which involved several teaching and mentorship experiences, workshops, and the implementation of an education research project. My project centered on assessing the efficacy of the Phylogenetic Biogeography Workshop and the activities we incorporated.

My career goals are to teach biology at a primarily undergraduate institution, to mentor undergraduate researchers, and to continue engaging in pedagogical research. I am planning to defend my dissertation in Summer 2026, and I will be applying to positions starting this fall. A full CV can be found here: [CV](http://sswiston.github.io/files/Swiston_CV.pdf)
